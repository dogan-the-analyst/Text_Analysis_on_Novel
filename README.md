# Text Analysis on Novel

## Overview
This project demonstrates a workflow for analyzing textual data using Python. The analysis is performed on a sample text file, which is sourced from the Gutenberg Project. The notebook includes steps for reading, cleaning, and analyzing the text data, making it a practical guide for basic text analysis tasks.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Reads a text file (e.g., `pg1400.txt`) into Python for processing.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the text for analysis by removing unwanted characters and standardizing formatting.
- **Text Analysis**: Performs exploratory analysis, such as word frequency counts and potential visualization.

## File Structure
- `text_analysis.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the workflow.
- `pg1400.txt`: The sample text file used for analysis (ensure this file is in the same directory as the notebook).
- `man_in_top_hat.jpeg`: The image used for word cloud.

## Example Outputs
- Word frequency analysis
- Visualizations showcasing the distribution of text data (e.g., histograms, word clouds)
